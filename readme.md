# FizzBuzz as a Service

This web app is an implementation of FBaaS in PHP. It is inspired by the work 
of github user [tomjakubowski](https://github.com/tomjakubowski/fbaas). 

## Specification

See the [README authored by 
Tom](https://github.com/tomjakubowski/fbaas/blob/master/README.md)

## My Implementation

I'm [Nick](http://nick.gs/) and I wrote this using the (Slim 
Framework)[http://slimframework.com/] and deployed it on 
(OpenShift)[http://openshift.redhat.com], the PaaS offered by Red Hat. [It can 
be viewed there](http://fbaas-sevengraff.rhcloud.com/index.php/fizzbuzz/1,100)
